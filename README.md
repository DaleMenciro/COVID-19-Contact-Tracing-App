# COVID-19-Contact-Tracing-App

The main purpose of this application is to help users keep track of their potential COVID-19 exposure and monitor any related symptoms they might have. By allowing users to enter their personal information, the app creates and stores records in a secure database. Each time users make a new entry, they can conveniently monitor their interactions and health status, which improves COVID-19 contact tracing and symptom tracking.


## Features
### Search Feature:
The search functionality allows users to look up information related to potential COVID-19 exposure. Users can enter their name or relevant details, and the app will query its database to locate and display any potential matches. This empowers users to identify if they have been in close contact with a COVID-19 positive individual or visited a location with a known exposure risk.
### Entry Feature:
When users access the entry feature, they are prompted to enter their name, gender, phone number, and email address. These details serve as vital contact information to enable health authorities to reach out if necessary. Additionally, the app collects the user's vaccination status, providing valuable data on vaccination coverage within the community.

### Data Security and Privacy
The app places a strong emphasis on data security and privacy. User data is encrypted and stored securely, adhering to relevant data protection regulations. Personal information is kept anonymous, ensuring that individual identities remain protected. The app maintains strict confidentiality and only provides essential information to authorized health authorities for contact tracing purposes.
